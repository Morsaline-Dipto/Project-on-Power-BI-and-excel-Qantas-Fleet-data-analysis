# Project-on-Power-BI-and-excel-Qantas-Fleet-data-analysis
This project is about data analysis on Qantas airlines. The dataset used for this project is imported from kaggle.
Disclaimer: This is not any official data analysis file. This file is created to demonstrate data anlysis skills and practice.
I have used Power Query for data cleaning. I have used Power BI for visual presentation. 
Few highlights of my data analysis are: Aircaft model, Aircraft manufacturing country, Aircraft registration holding cointry, Engine type and manufacturer and many more.
